# CounterSimple
A simple counter app using React Native for the InfoStudio session at Kelaniya University

## What's this and how did this get here?

Well, there's this amazing tool called [react-native-cli](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/understanding-cli). I just ran `react-native init SimpleCounter` and voila! we have the basic structure of a React Native project. You can try it too.

After that, it's just moving a few files around and creating some new files. You can go through the commits of you want to.

### Prerequisites
 - You need `node` > 8 installed in your system. Try [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), it's cool.
 - To run/debug/package for Android, you need to [setup your development environment](https://developer.android.com/topic/instant-apps/getting-started/setup.html)
 - To run/debug/package for iOS, you need to [setup your development environment](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppStoreDistributionTutorial/Setup/Setup.html)
